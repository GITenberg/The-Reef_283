description: "The Reef is a 1912 novel by American writer Edith Wharton. It was published\
  \ by D. Appleton & Company. It concerns a romance between a widow and her former\
  \ lover. The novel takes place in Paris and rural France, but primarily features\
  \ American characters. While writing the novel, Edith Wharton visited England, Sicily,\
  \ and Germany, among other locations. In a letter to Bernard Berenson in November\
  \ 1912, Wharton expressed regret regarding her novel, calling it a “poor miserable\
  \ lifeless lump”. She wrote, “Anyhow, remember it’s not me, though I thought it\
  \ was when I was writing it—& that next time I’m going to do something worthwhile!!”\n\
